;; Pixel-level proof that kami-app-isekai.voxel-world's terrain-height kernel ACTUALLY renders as
;; real GPU pixels through kami.sprite-gpu (kotoba-lang/webgpu) — the same GPU-instanced-quad
;; pipeline other kami-* repos already draw through. This closes the maturity gap a 2026-07 audit
;; found: kami-app-isekai is 4 pure `.cljc` kernels extracted from a deleted Rust crate with NO
;; rendering integration anywhere — the terrain-height rule (2-octave value-noise ridge, the same
;; math terrain-voxel-at uses to decide stone/grass/air per voxel column) had never produced a
;; single verified pixel.
;;
;; This samples terrain-height over a top-down grid of world (x,z) coordinates, maps each height to
;; a color via kami-app-isekai.heightmap-color (deep blue low -> grass green mid -> near-white
;; high), and draws one colored :rect quad per cell through kami.sprite-gpu's sprite-SDF pipeline —
;; reusing kotoba-lang/webgpu's own real-headless-Chromium/WebGL2 harness (`kami.playwright`)
;; verbatim, in the same style as that repo's test/playwright_frame_test.clj and
;; kami-isekai-assets' test/render_pixel_test.clj: compile+link the SAME sprite-SDF GLSL fixture
;; those tests use, draw an instanced quad pass into a real WebGL2 canvas, then `readPixels` actual
;; on-screen bytes and compare them against colors computed independently from the kernel's own
;; math (kami-app-isekai.voxel-world/terrain-height -> kami-app-isekai.heightmap-color/height->color
;; -> expected sRGB byte), not a guessed/hand-tuned color.
;;
;; This is a plain .clj (not .cljc) test on purpose, and it lives in its OWN `render-test/`
;; directory rather than `test/`: kami.playwright/kami.sprite-gpu/kami.wgsl live in the sibling
;; kotoba-lang/webgpu repo (+ ITS sibling kotoba-lang/expr, for kotoba.expr), not this repo's own
;; deps.edn — kami-app-isekai stays zero-dep/portable for everyone who doesn't want the render
;; pipeline, and `clojure -M:test` (cognitect test-runner, which auto-requires every namespace
;; under `:extra-paths ["test"]`) must never try to load this file. Run with bb, classpath
;; assembled from the 3 sibling checkouts, from a cwd of the webgpu checkout (its
;; `fixtures/glsl/*` are read cwd-relative, matching every other playwright_*_test.clj there):
;;
;;   cd ../webgpu && bb --classpath "../kami-app-isekai/src:../kami-app-isekai/render-test:src:../expr/src" \
;;     -f ../kami-app-isekai/render-test/render_pixel_test.clj
;;
;; (adjust the ../webgpu / ../expr / ../kami-app-isekai paths to wherever those checkouts live —
;; see this repo's .github/workflows/ci.yml's render-verify job for the exact CI layout, and
;; bb.edn's render-test task for a local one-liner given the west-managed sibling layout under
;; orgs/kotoba-lang/{kami-app-isekai,webgpu,expr}).
