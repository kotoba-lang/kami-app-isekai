;; スライムハント (Slime Hunt) scene-authoring script — bakes
;; public/games/slime-hunt/scene.edn from real composers, not hand-typed pixel art:
;;   - kami.isekai.chargen/compose-character  → the player's visual sprite + PBR fallback profile
;;   - kami.isekai.monsters/compose-slime*    → 3 elemental slime variants (green/fire/ice)
;;   - kami.isekai.status/compute-stats       → the player's :spd stat, which derives the
;;                                              move-speed multiplier documented below
;;   - kami-app-isekai.voxel-world/terrain-height + .heightmap-color → a baked, static,
;;     colored terrain grid for the arena background (this repo's own pixel-verified kernel,
;;     see render-test/render_pixel_test.clj — first real use of it in an actual game, not a
;;     standalone demo)
;;
;; Run: `clojure -M:gen-scene` from the repo root (needs the sibling kotoba-lang/
;; kami-isekai-assets checkout the :gen-scene alias points at). Output is plain EDN you could
;; equally hand-edit afterward — this script exists for reproducibility/attribution of where
;; the visuals and the speed number came from, not as a runtime dependency of the game itself
;; (the game only ever reads the baked public/games/slime-hunt/scene.edn, see dev/slime_hunt/game.cljs).
