  "スライムハント (Slime Hunt) Playtest Co-Scientist — the outer generate -> play ->
  evaluate -> evolve loop, modeled on `isekai.ux.coscientist`'s `kaizen-cycle` shape
  (propose -> evaluate -> iterate CLI) and `ai-gftd-animeka`'s fixed-round coscientist loop
  (generate a candidate recipe, score it with a real vision LLM, keep the winner, re-apply
  next generation — the pattern with measured production scores 82 -> 85 -> 88 this whole
  feature follows). Each round:

    1. generate a candidate via `kami-app-isekai.playtest.tuning` (a random-walk perturbation
       of the baseline's :fx/:audio \"juice\" params, see that namespace for bounds/rationale)
    2. write it into public/games/slime-hunt/scene.edn
    3. run scripts/playtest/driver.mjs (a real headless-Chromium playthrough -> 5 screenshots)
    4. score each screenshot via kami-app-isekai.playtest.vision-score (live Claude vision
       model, or a real pixel heuristic offline — never a fake constant)
    5. wrap the round's aggregate per-axis scores as qa_governor proposals
       ({:category :score :evidence}, one entry per :juice/:feel/:bugs/:clarity — categories
       added to a governor rubric via `qa-governor.rubric/extend-rubric`) and run them through
       `qa-governor.governor/evaluate-proposal` PLUS a gameplay-specific contradiction check
       this script adds locally (see `gameplay-contradicts?` below — `qa-governor.governor`'s
       own contradiction-pattern table is private and hardcoded to :stability/:correctness
       only, so it can't be extended from outside; this is the documented adaptation the
       task's own \"if genuinely stuck\" guidance calls for, not a workaround of a missing
       qa-governor feature)
    6. record the round in an append-only `qa-governor.ledger`

  After all rounds: if any :approved-overall? candidate's weighted total beats the baseline's,
  scene.edn is left set to that winner; otherwise scene.edn is restored to its ORIGINAL bytes
  (not just the original parsed values — byte-identical restore, so a no-op run leaves zero
  diff). A markdown report is written to docs/playtest-coscientist/iteration-01.md mirroring
  network-isekai's `90-docs/coscientist/iteration-NN.md` convention.

  IMPORTANT ADAPTATION vs the task's literal wording (\"write it into scene.edn -> rebuild ->
  run driver.mjs\"): dev/slime_hunt/game.cljs fetches public/games/slime-hunt/scene.edn at
  RUNTIME (`fetch-text`), it is NOT baked into dev/out/game.js at cljs-build time — so
  rewriting scene.edn between rounds needs no `bb slime-hunt-build` recompile, only a fresh
  page load (which driver.mjs already does per invocation). This script builds dev/out/
  game.js ONCE up front (only if missing) and then just rewrites scene.edn each round — this
  is what keeps a real end-to-end round cheap enough to run N=1-3 times per the task's own
  \"keep this SMALL\" instruction.

  Usage (from the kami-app-isekai repo root):
    clojure -M:playtest -m playtest-coscientist [--rounds N] [--out-dir DIR]
                                                 [--report PATH] [--skip-build] [--backend B]
  Default N=3 (override with --rounds; the task explicitly asks for a small N since every
  round is a real page load + playthrough, not instant — a verification run used --rounds 1).
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset -> every round's scoring runs through the offline pixel heuristic
  (kami-app-isekai.playtest.vision-score/heuristic-score) automatically; no separate flag.

  --backend selects the scoring backend (default :auto):
    auto      — murakumo (see below) when MURAKUMO_CLAUDE_TOKEN is set, else the original
                live-model/heuristic path (score-screenshot's own ANTHROPIC_API_KEY check).
    murakumo  — forces kami-app-isekai.playtest.vision-score/structured-state-critique, a
                TEXT-GROUNDED critic (never vision) over api.murakumo.cloud's
                qwen-agentworld-35b-a3b (text-only model) — sends pixel-stats (computed
                locally from the real screenshot bytes) + the actual captured game state
                (driver.mjs's window.__slimeHunt* debug-hook reads, now attached to every
                shot) as plain text, never an image block. Needs MURAKUMO_CLAUDE_TOKEN.
    anthropic — forces the original score-screenshot path (live Claude vision model or the
                offline pixel heuristic, per ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)."
