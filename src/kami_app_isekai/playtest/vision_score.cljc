  "Vision-LLM quality scoring for スライムハント (Slime Hunt) playtest screenshots — the
  Playtest Co-Scientist's evaluate step. Wraps `langchain.jvm/vision-json`
  (kotoba-lang/langchain), following the exact proven call pattern
  `ai-gftd-project-mangaka`'s `mangaka.graphs.vision-score`/`mangaka.llm` already run in
  production (`(llm/vision-json prompt img)` -> a structured map, `parse-structured` ->
  nil on an unparseable reply): build a multimodal prompt+image message
  (`langchain.jvm/vision-content`, used internally by `vision-json`), send it through an
  injected `ChatModel` (`langchain.model/anthropic-model`), parse the JSON reply.

  4 axes (matching this session's own quality dimensions from repeatedly play-testing this
  game): :juice (見た目・演出), :feel (遊びやすさ・バランス), :bugs (bug-FREE-ness — 100 =
  nothing looks broken/glitched/stuck), :clarity (does the screenshot legibly communicate
  what just happened — pickup/hit/victory/game-over feedback).

  Credential convention (same as `isekai.ux.coscientist`/`mangaka.llm`): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  env var, nil -> graceful degrade. Unlike the generic `langchain.jvm/chat-model` mock (which
  just echoes text — useless here, `vision-json`'s `parse-structured` would return nil on an
  echoed reply, i.e. no score at all), the offline path here is a REAL pixel heuristic over
  the actual screenshot bytes (`heuristic-score` below) — every field varies with the real
  image, never a fake constant. No new credential-fetching machinery: env var only.

  ── murakumo backend (a THIRD backend, alongside live-model/heuristic-score above, never
  deleting either) — REAL VISION as of 2026-07-09 ──

  `gftdcojp/api.murakumo.cloud` (repo local-murakumo) is a public Cloudflare Worker exposing
  an Anthropic-Messages-API-compatible bridge at POST /v1/messages. Its backing model was
  replaced 2026-07-09: qwen-agentworld-35b-a3b (TEXT-ONLY — local-murakumo.anthropic/
  anthropic-content->text used to strip any \"image\" content block server-side and replace it
  with a placeholder string) -> qwen3.6-35b-a3b, which is now confirmed VISION-CAPABLE
  (`gftdcojp/local-murakumo` PR #34, merged: `anthropic-msg->openai` now builds real OpenAI
  `image_url` content-parts for Anthropic-shaped \"image\" content blocks instead of stripping
  them — verified live against the deployed instance).

  `murakumo-vision-critique` below is the PRIMARY path: it sends the ACTUAL screenshot as a
  base64 PNG image content block, reusing the exact same multimodal-message-building code the
  direct-Anthropic `live-model` path already uses (`langchain.jvm/vision-json` ->
  `vision-text` -> `vision-content`) — the only difference from `score-screenshot`'s live path
  is which ChatModel it's pointed at (`murakumo-critic-model`/`murakumo-url` instead of
  api.anthropic.com's default model/url). This is genuine vision scoring: the model sees
  pixels directly, same as the direct-Anthropic path.

  `structured-state-critique` (the original TEXT-ONLY path, built when the backing model was
  still text-only) is KEPT but demoted to a defensive fallback ONLY — it builds a rich TEXT
  description combining `pixel-stats` (mean-luma/luma-stddev/vivid-frac/n-colors, computed
  from the real screenshot bytes) and the actual captured game state (driver.mjs's
  __slimeHunt* debug-hook reads), and sends THAT as a plain text message, never an image
  block. `murakumo-critique` (the new top-level entry point callers should use) tries the
  vision path first and only falls through to this text-only path if the vision call's reply
  fails to parse — covering the case where a future model swap regresses vision support
  without anyone updating this file. Under normal operation (qwen3.6-35b-a3b, vision-capable,
  confirmed working) the fallback is never exercised.

  Token convention matches `kotoba-lang/murakumo`'s `bin/claude-murakumo` launcher: the
  `MURAKUMO_CLAUDE_TOKEN` env var (must equal the Worker's `ANTHROPIC_PROXY_TOKEN` secret),
  nil -> graceful degrade (same shape as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` above — env var only, no
  in-process 1Password shellout; export `MURAKUMO_CLAUDE_TOKEN=$(op item get
  \"gftd.murakumo/ANTHROPIC_PROXY_TOKEN\" --vault gftdcojp --fields credential --reveal)`
  before invoking this script if sourcing from 1Password)."

       :juice   color richness (:n-colors) + :vivid-frac, a proxy for particle bursts / FX
                reading as visually alive vs a flat, monochrome frame.
       :bugs    bug-FREE-ness. Penalizes a near-uniform frame (luma :luma-stddev below a

                here so this axis is never mistaken for a real feel signal when offline.
