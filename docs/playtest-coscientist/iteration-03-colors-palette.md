## Per-moment director-persona notes (baseline)

- **title**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The 'slimes' are lifeless geometric primitives with no personality or charm. The title screen lacks any sense of play or invitation, reading more like a spreadsheet than a game world. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The UI is a disaster of illegible text. A wall of technical jargon obscures the gameplay elements, and the 'Press Start' prompt is tiny and easily missed. This is not accessible to anyone. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This is a grey, flat void with no atmosphere, lighting, or depth. The graphics are placeholder-quality circles and ellipses. It looks like a rendering engine test, not a place to inhabit.
- **pickup**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The collision resolution is visually silent and flat; the player sprite just stops against the orb without any squash, stretch, or particle feedback to signal a successful grab, making the core loop feel like walking into a wall rather than a satisfying interaction. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The massive, semi-transparent instructional overlay and the raw debug log at the top completely obscure the gameplay, making it impossible to discern the player's boundaries or the objective state at a glance, which is a fundamental failure of readability. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This reads as a raw white-box test build rather than a designed space; the visible coordinate axes, floating text blocks, and lack of atmospheric lighting or environmental detail strip all sense of place from the arena, leaving it feeling like a hollow tech demo.
- **victory**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] This is a static, lifeless text dump; where is the 'pop' of victory? A real game would have particles, a screen shake, or a satisfying musical cue here, not this flat, unresponsive white text. The developer log pasted at the top is an insult to immersion—it screams 'prototype' rather than 'play'. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The UI is confusing and broken; why is a README file visible at the top of the screen? A player cannot understand the state honestly when compilation instructions obscure the game world. The HUD hearts float aimlessly without a container, and the victory text is cluttered and hard to read against the shapes. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] There is zero sense of place or atmosphere here; this looks like a sterile tech demo or a whitebox level. The 'slimes' are just generic colored ellipses with eyes, and the 'kotodama' is a brown circle—there is no art direction, no lighting, and no soul. It feels like a developer tool, not a world.
- **hit**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The 'hit' moment is visually dead; a massive, featureless purple circle appearing behind the player communicates nothing about impact or physics, and the total absence of screen shake or particle feedback makes the core loop feel weightless and unresponsive. The raw debug text plastered at the top of the screen completely destroys the tactile promise of the game before you even begin. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] Readability is severely compromised by a massive information leak; showing raw coordinate data, compilation status ('compiled -> 2962 bytes'), and control instructions directly on the gameplay canvas is unacceptable for a polished experience. Furthermore, the oversized purple circle obscures the player entity, making it impossible to distinguish the hit state or the player's precise location relative to the danger zones. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This reads less like a game and more like a sterile engine test harness; the rigid, repeating grid background and floating, unanchored assets (like the inexplicable sword icon) suggest a tech demo rather than an inhabited world. The debug overlay is a jarring failure of presentation that breaks all immersion and suggests the developer is looking at code rather than the player experience.
- **gameover**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] This feels like a wireframe, not a game. There is zero 'impact' or 'anticipation' in the visuals—the 'Game Over' text is flat and lifeless, and the slimes look like static stickers. The massive block of instructional text at the top breaks the fourth wall and kills any sense of fun or immersion immediately. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The visual hierarchy is broken. The HUD is nearly invisible against the dark background, and the 'Game Over' text is buried in the center. A player wouldn't understand the state of the game because the debug information at the top explains the mechanics better than the UI does. It feels unfair and unpolished. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This looks like a raw engine debug view, not an inhabited world. The 'slimes' are just circles with eyes, lacking any personality or presence. The debug text overlay ('Compiled via kotoba...') is a glaring error that screams 'unfinished prototype' rather than a crafted experience.

## ✅ Verdict — BUILD gen-3

**gen-3** beat the baseline (16.9 -> 24.8, +7.9) and was governor-approved — `scene.edn` was left set to this candidate's params.

## Screenshots (not published — local-only PNGs, see --out-dir)

- gen-4: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover

## → Seed for next iteration

This pass only tunes :fx/:audio params (kami-app-isekai.playtest.tuning/tunable-paths) — logic.cljc gameplay speeds/ranges/layout are explicitly out of scope (documented follow-up, not built now). A follow-up iteration could: (1) extend tunable-paths to :render/sky or particle :colors as a small categorical choice set (deliberately excluded from this pass's numeric random-walk, see tuning.cljc), (2) raise --rounds once round latency is validated in CI, (3) wire the live Claude vision path into a scheduled run once ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is available in that environment.
