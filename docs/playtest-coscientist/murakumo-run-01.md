# Playtest Co-Scientist — iteration 01 (スライムハント / Slime Hunt)

> Driver: scripts/playtest/driver.mjs (real headless-Chromium playthrough, kotoba-lang/webgpu PR #9's `chromium.executablePath()` technique) · Scorer: kami-app-isekai.playtest.vision-score (0 candidate round(s) + 1 baseline round) · Judge: kotoba-lang/qa-governor (rubric + governor + append-only ledger) · following the ai-gftd-animeka coscientist pattern (generate -> score -> keep-winner) and isekai.ux.coscientist's propose/evaluate/iterate CLI shape.

Scoring backend: **murakumo structured-state critic** (api.murakumo.cloud / qwen-agentworld-35b-a3b — TEXT-ONLY model, sent pixel-stats + captured game state as plain text, NOT a screenshot image; see `kami-app-isekai.playtest.vision-score/structured-state-critique`)

## ★ Measured baseline

- total=62.1 grade=c verdict=rejected
- scores: juice=33.4, feel=78.4, bugs=92.4, clarity=53.0
- driver: victory phase=victory, lose phase=gameover

## Roadmap (rounds tried)

| round | total | grade | verdict | scores | victory | lose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|


## Params tried per round



## ✅ Verdict — reverted to baseline

No round beat the baseline's total (62.1) with an approved verdict — `scene.edn` was restored to its original bytes (byte-identical, zero working-tree diff).

## Screenshots (not published — local-only PNGs, see --out-dir)

- baseline: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover

## → Seed for next iteration

This pass only tunes :fx/:audio params (kami-app-isekai.playtest.tuning/tunable-paths) — logic.cljc gameplay speeds/ranges/layout are explicitly out of scope (documented follow-up, not built now). A follow-up iteration could: (1) extend tunable-paths to :render/sky or particle :colors as a small categorical choice set (deliberately excluded from this pass's numeric random-walk, see tuning.cljc), (2) raise --rounds once round latency is validated in CI, (3) wire the live Claude vision path into a scheduled run once ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is available in that environment.
