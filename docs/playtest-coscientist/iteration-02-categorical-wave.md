## Per-moment director-persona notes (baseline)

- **title**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] This is a wireframe with text pasted on top, not a game world. Where is the tactile joy of the slimes? They are flat, lifeless circles with no personality or squash-and-stretch potential visible. You cannot make a 'Hunt' feel like a hunt when the enemies look like static UI icons. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] You are showing a compiler log to the player on the title screen. Strip out the 'Compiled via kotoba.engine-clj' text immediately. A new player has no business knowing how you built this; it destroys immersion and makes the game look broken before they even press start. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This feels like a test room in a game engine, not an arena. The grid background is too prominent and distracting, reminding me of a debug view rather than a grassy field or forest. The slimes are just floating heads with no integration into a 'place'. Give them a habitat, not a coordinate plane.
- **pickup**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The tactile feedback is virtually non-existent; the tiny white '+1' is a whisper when a shout is needed, and the total lack of squash/stretch or impact frames makes the movement feel like sliding on frictionless ice rather than a satisfying physical interaction. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] You are literally rendering the compiler stack trace and engine build status over the gameplay area, which is an insult to the player's intelligence and completely breaks the fourth wall; a player cannot possibly understand the game state with that text obscuring the top of the screen. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This looks like a raw WebGL debug canvas rather than a game world; the 'slimes' are just circles with eyes pasted on them, and the background is a static gradient grid that feels like a placeholder for a level design tool, not an inhabited, living environment.
- **victory**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The victory moment is completely dead on arrival; you've earned a fanfare and a flash, but got a static text overlay instead. It kills the momentum instantly—collecting 8 items should feel like a crescendo, not a flatline. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The UI is actively lying to the player: the HUD says '7/8' while the screen screams 'Clear!', creating immediate confusion about the state. Also, the 'press SPACE' prompt is tucked away in the corner like an afterthought, failing to invite the player into a satisfying loop of replay. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This looks like a developer console output rather than a game state; the background is just a grid and the 'sword' asset is floating randomly without context. It feels like a tech demo, not a place a player would want to inhabit.
- **hit**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The 'hit' moment has absolutely zero weight or feedback; the slimes are static circles that feel like dead geometry rather than living threats. There is no 'pop,' 'squash,' or particle burst to suggest impact—it is purely mathematical collision detection presented as a game. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The player character (the tiny orange dot) is visually indistinguishable from the large orange circle behind it, making readability impossible. The HUD is an intrusive black box that explains controls like a manual rather than letting the game teach itself, and the visible debug log proves this build is unstable. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This is not a world; it is a spreadsheet with colored circles on it. The green grid background is a functional debug aid, not an aesthetic choice for an inhabited place, and the 'slimes' lack any texture, atmosphere, or sense of presence to make them feel like characters.
- **gameover**: [宮本茂-style (game feel)] The slimes are static, flat ellipses with absolutely no 'squish' or 'bounce'—they feel like paper cutouts. The 'やられた' text is a generic system font with zero stylistic integration or impact frames. It reads like a spreadsheet error, not a satisfying, tactile game event. / [桜井政博-style (accessibility/fairness)] The massive debug banner at the top explicitly hides the '1/8' progress counter, meaning a player cannot know how close they were to winning. The 'Press SPACE' retry instruction is illegibly small and crammed against the score; in a polished game, the call to action must be the loudest element on screen. / [青沼英二-style (presentation/sense of place)] This looks like a CAD wireframe, not an inhabited world. The background is a dead, static grid with zero atmosphere, and the slimes lack shadow or depth, floating in a void. It feels like a tech demo room rather than a designed environment; there is no sense of place or 'weight' to the objects.

## ✅ Verdict — BUILD gen-1

**gen-1** beat the baseline (23.1 -> 25.7, +2.6) and was governor-approved — `scene.edn` was left set to this candidate's params.

## Screenshots (not published — local-only PNGs, see --out-dir)

- baseline: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover
- gen-1: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover
- gen-2: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover
- gen-3: title, pickup, victory, hit, gameover

## → Seed for next iteration

This pass only tunes :fx/:audio params (kami-app-isekai.playtest.tuning/tunable-paths) — logic.cljc gameplay speeds/ranges/layout are explicitly out of scope (documented follow-up, not built now). A follow-up iteration could: (1) extend tunable-paths to :render/sky or particle :colors as a small categorical choice set (deliberately excluded from this pass's numeric random-walk, see tuning.cljc), (2) raise --rounds once round latency is validated in CI, (3) wire the live Claude vision path into a scheduled run once ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is available in that environment.
