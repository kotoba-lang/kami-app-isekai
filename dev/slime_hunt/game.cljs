  "スライムハント (Slime Hunt) — the playable harness.

   Same architecture gftdcojp/network-isekai's `isekai.game` already runs in production
   (verified live: `drive`/KAMI Drive uses this exact shape): `public/games/slime-hunt/
   logic.cljc` is compiled to real WASM bytes via `kotoba.engine-clj` (ast → codegen →
   wasm-bytes — a `.cljc` port of the same compiler `isekai.game` uses; this repo's PR
   description documents the standalone JVM+Node smoke test that proved the compiled bytes
   actually instantiate and run correctly against `kami.host`'s ABI before this harness was
   written), instantiated against `kami.host` (kotoba-lang/webgpu — the browser ECS/ABI host),
   ticked every `requestAnimationFrame`, and rendered via `kami.scene2d` + `kami.webgl`
   (GPU-instanced 2D quads, WebGL2 — the same `kami.sprite-gpu` pipeline this repo's own
   render-test already pixel-verified for `terrain-height`, not Canvas2D).

   Trimmed from `isekai.game.cljc`'s ~700 lines to this game's own needs: no netsync/level/
   itonami-bridge/leaderboard/combo/FSM-driven player animation/hit-stop (all opt-in bits
   network-isekai uses for OTHER games or that don't apply to a static top-down sprite — the win/
   lose GAMEPLAY is unaffected). What IS kept, because the task requires it: the exact generic
   win/lose convention — game-over fires when the \"player\"-tagged entity count hits 0,
   victory fires when the \"picked\"-tagged count reaches `scene :flow :victory :when-picked`
   (see `victory-picked` / `game-over?`/`victory?` below) — read from scene.edn data, not
   hardcoded here, exactly like drive.

   2026-07-09 quality pass (real Playwright playtesting — see this repo's PR description for
   the evidence): the MVP had zero audio and zero hit/pickup/invuln feedback despite `kami.audio`
   + `kami.scene2d/frame-quads`'s own `fx`/`shake` params being right there and already proven in
   production by `isekai.game`'s `spawn-burst`/`step-fx`/`popup-fx`/screen-shake pattern (see
   below `run-loop!`). This pass wires exactly that pattern in — sfx + particle bursts + a brief
   screen-shake on hit, a floating \"+1\" + sparkle on pickup, a translucent flicker ring driven
   directly off the REAL `invuln` defatom (via `host/globals`, not a separate timer) so the post-
   hit grace window is finally visible, and sfx + a CSS pop-in on the victory/game-over cards."

;; scene2d's private `rgba` just `vec`s whatever it's given), and `(vec "#fff3b0")` would
;; silently explode a hex string into a vector of individual characters — isekai's own hex-
;; string burst colors only make sense on its Canvas2D fallback path, which this game doesn't
